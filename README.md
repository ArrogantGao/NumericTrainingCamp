# Scientific Computing Training Camp (Basic)

Different ways to simulate the dynamics of Rydberg atoms arrays.

## Topics
1. [Tensor Networks](1.tensor-networks/)
2. [Molecular Dynamics](2.molecular-dynamics/)
3. [Quantum Monte Carlo](3.quantum-monte-carlo/)
4. [Computational Complexity](4.computational-complexity/)

## Inputs
1. **Work on a project** under the chosen topic in the same space from 9:30AM-9:30PM.
2. **Bidaily presentation and report** at 4:00 PM, each group has 15min to report the project progress in the meeting. Write a report and push it to this GitLab repo before 9:30PM. The report should be written in [Markdown](https://markdownguide.org/) format.
3. A final report in the Markdown format, which will be deployed to the [training camp website](https://codingthrust.github.io/trainingcamp/)

Note: each participant (including instructors) has 48 hour leave. Quitting is only allowed at the first 3 days.

> He who learns must suffer. And even in our sleep pain that cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, and in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom to us by the awful grace of God. -- Aeschylus

## Expected output
1. A final report in Markdown format.
2. Some research projects.

## Events
**Talks**
1. Zhao-Long Gu, Cluster perturbation theory
2. Nv-Sen Ma, Monte Carlo method
3. Lei Wang if possible.

**Mini-lectures**
1. Jin-Guo Liu, [Tensor network methods](./0.intro/tenosr-network.md)
2. Zhao-Long Gu, 
3. Xi Dai's student maybe?

## Guide
#### Report writing
The report in the Markdown format should be submitted to this repository, under the folder of the corresponding topic. Please check preview events (e.g. [this one](https://code.hkust-gz.edu.cn/jinguoliu/rydbergtrainingmaterials/-/tree/main/2.error-correction/reports?ref_type=heads) for examples.
