# Scientific Computing Training Camp (Basic)
May 27 to June 9, 2024 (14 days) at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). Not open for registration.

During the 14 days, you will **implement an algorithm**, simulate a many-body system, and write a report.

> Talk is cheap. Show me the code. - Linus Torvalds

## Topics
1. [Tensor Networks](1.tensor-networks/)
2. [Machine Learning and Molecular Dynamics](2.molecular-dynamics/)
3. [Quantum Monte Carlo](3.quantum-monte-carlo/)
4. [Computational Complexity](4.computational-complexity/)

## Inputs
1. **Work on a project** under the chosen topic, in the meeting room, from 9:30AM-9:30PM.
2. **Bidaily presentation and report** at 4:00 PM, each group has 15min to report the project progress in the meeting. Write a report and push it to this GitLab repo before 9:30PM. The report should be written in [Markdown](https://markdownguide.org/) format.
3. A final report in the Markdown format, which will be deployed to the [training camp website](https://codingthrust.github.io/trainingcamp/).

Note: each participant (including instructors) has 48 hour leave. Quitting is only allowed at the first 3 days.

## Expected output
1. A final report in Markdown format.
2. Some research projects.

## Events
**Talks**
1. Yi-Jia Wang, Tensor network message passing[^Wang2024]
2. Xiu-Hao Deng, Quantum random walk
3. Zhao-Long Gu, 

**Mini-lectures**
1. Jin-Guo Liu, [Tensor network methods](./0.intro/tenosr-network.md)
2. Lei Wang, TBD
3. Ze-Cheng Gan, PDE/ODE

## Guide
#### Report writing
The report in the Markdown format should be submitted to this repository, under the folder of the corresponding topic. Please check preview events (e.g. [this one](https://code.hkust-gz.edu.cn/jinguoliu/rydbergtrainingmaterials/-/tree/main/2.error-correction/reports?ref_type=heads)) for references.
